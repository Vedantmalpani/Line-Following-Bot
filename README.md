# Line-Following-Bot
It is an automated bot which follows a visual line embedded on the floor or ceiling using arduino and Infrared sensors


As interpreted by the name itself, it is an automated bot which follows a visual line embedded on the floor or ceiling. For this project, we have considered a black line embedded on the floor in order to get an absolute observant of infra-red radiations. So that we can use the absolute observant property of black colour. Certain advanced line follower bots use invisible magnetic fields as their path.
